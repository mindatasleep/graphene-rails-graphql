# Project Overview

A web app with that integrates health data from 3rd-party systems and stores it in a PostgreSQL database using a GraphQL API.

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a new API standard that provides a more efficient, powerful and flexible alternative to REST.

GraphQL represents a massive leap forward for API development. Type safety, introspection, generated documentation, and predictable responses benefit both the maintainers and consumers of our platform. Some benefits are:

* Naturally query nested information
* Avoid under / over fetching data
* Adjust data retrieval to the front-end's needs
* Reason locally about data structures
* Declarative data fetching, rather than imperative as with REST
